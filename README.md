## Assessment 1: Temperature Analysis

- I created a NumPy array with some temperature values in Celsius.
- Then I calculated:
  - The average temperature
  - The highest and lowest temperatures
  - Converted all temperatures into Fahrenheit
  - Found out which days had temperature above 20Â°C

## Assessment 2: Array Basics

- I created an array with the first 10 positive numbers.
- Then I printed the array, checked its shape and data type.
- I also multiplied each element by 2 and printed the new values.



## Assessment 3: Student Scores

- I made a 2D array showing test scores of 5 students in 3 subjects.
- Then I calculated:
  - The average score of each student
  - The average score in each subject
  - Which student had the highest total marks
  - Added 5 bonus marks to the third subject for all students
